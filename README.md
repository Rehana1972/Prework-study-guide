# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation was to gain further knowledge of coding.

I built this project so that I can gain some experience going into the coding bootcamp in order to further understand it better.  I was also motivated to do this because I wanted to have a career change.

Building this project helped me understand how a webpage is created, all of the time and work that is invested in it and how to fix bugs when things are not going as planned.  It also gave me a wonderful feeling of accomplishment once I debugged an issue and things started to work as they should.
